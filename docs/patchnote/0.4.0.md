For the details, read the [post](https://github.com/crimson206/intelli-type/blob/main/docs/escape/escape_scheme.md).

In this version, I confirmed that all the unittests for version 0.3.1 succeed. Since I brought back the 0.1.3 version syntax, I need to add unittests for it as soon as possible. Nevertheless, I am publishing version 0.4.0 without a pre-release because it does not affect the existing 0.3.1 version syntax and functionality.
